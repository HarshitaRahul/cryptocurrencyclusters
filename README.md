# cryptocurrencyclusters
This report is generated of what cryptocurrencies are available on the trading market and how they can be grouped using classification. I have used unsupervivsed machine learning and Amazon SageMaker by clustering cryptocurrencies and creating plots to present the results.

The following tasks have been completed:

Data Preprocessing: Prepare data for dimension reduction with PCA and clustering using K-Means.
Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA: Reduce data dimension using the PCA algorithm from sklearn.
Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-Means: Predict clusters using the cryptocurrencies data using the KMeans algorithm from sklearn.
Visualizing Results: Create some plots and data tables to present the results.


##Visualizing Results
Create a scatter plot  to present the clustered data about cryptocurrencies having x="TotalCoinsMined" and y="TotalCoinSupply" to contrast the number of available coins versus the total number of mined coins.
